# My first mkdocs plugin!

Now my blogs can be read to you!
<!-- more -->
I'm pretty excited for this preliminary push of an mkdocs plugin that leverages the amazon tts "polly" to create audio files for each blog on my site when it's built!

This is a cool accessibiliy feature I've seen on some sites and I thought it would be really interesting to see if I could implement it on my site as well.

ChatGPT got me started here but after some debugging and disecting I got it working. There are still some bugs but if you'd like to use it and contribute to it feel free!
